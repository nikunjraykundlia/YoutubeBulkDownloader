## üß© Troubleshooting

- **yt-dlp not found**: Make sure `yt-dlp` is installed and in your system PATH.
- **Port 5000 in use**: Stop other apps using this port or change the port in `server/index.ts`.
- **No 720p available**: Some videos are only available in 480p or lower; the app will download the best available up to your selected quality.
- **Browser blocks multiple downloads**: Use the ZIP download for bulk, or use the modal for individual downloads.
- **Permission errors on Windows**: Run your terminal as Administrator if you encounter file access issues.
