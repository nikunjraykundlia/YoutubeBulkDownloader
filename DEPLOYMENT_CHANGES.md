## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### YT-DLP Spawn Error (ENOENT)
**Issue**: `Failed to spawn yt-dlp: spawn yt-dlp ENOENT` on Render deployment

**Root Cause**: The application was trying to use system yt-dlp in production, but Render doesn't have yt-dlp installed globally.

**Solution**:
1. ✅ Updated download service to use local yt-dlp binary in production
2. ✅ Modified build script to copy yt-dlp binary to dist folder
3. ✅ Enhanced path detection to check multiple locations (dist/, root, system)
4. ✅ Added comprehensive error logging for debugging
5. ✅ Updated health check to verify yt-dlp availability
6. ✅ Enhanced download script to handle existing binaries

**Files Modified**:
- `server/services/download-service.ts` - Fixed yt-dlp path detection
- `package.json` - Updated build script to copy yt-dlp
- `server/index.ts` - Enhanced health check
- `scripts/download-ytdlp.js` - Added existence check

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Render Deployment Steps
1. **Fork Repository** - Clone to your GitHub account
2. **Deploy to Render** - Use the "Deploy to Render" button
3. **Automatic Setup** - Render will:
   - Install Node.js dependencies
   - Download yt-dlp binary
   - Build the application
   - Copy yt-dlp to dist folder
   - Start the production server
4. **Health Check** - Verify `/health` endpoint returns healthy status
5. **Test Downloads** - Try downloading a YouTube video

### Build Process
1. **Dependencies** - `npm install`
2. **YT-DLP Download** - `node scripts/download-ytdlp.js`
3. **Frontend Build** - `vite build`
4. **Backend Build** - `esbuild` bundling
5. **File Copying** - Copy services and yt-dlp to dist
6. **Permissions** - Make yt-dlp executable

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
- **URL**: `/health`
- **Response**: JSON with status, uptime, and yt-dlp availability
- **Status Codes**:
  - `200` - Healthy (yt-dlp available)
  - `200` - Degraded (yt-dlp not available but server running)
  - `500` - Unhealthy (server error)

### Logging
- Enhanced error logging for yt-dlp issues
- Environment-specific logging
- Request/response logging for API endpoints

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production mode
- `PORT=10000` - Server port (Render sets this automatically)

### File Structure (Production)
```
